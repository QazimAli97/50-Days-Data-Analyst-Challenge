# Day 14 – Region-wise Sales & Profit Analysis

## Objective
Analyze business performance across different regions to identify
high-performing and underperforming geographies and translate insights
into actionable business recommendations.

---

## Dataset
Source: Regional Sales Dataset  
Primary Table: Sales Orders  
Lookup Table: State Regions  

Each sales transaction was mapped to its corresponding region using
state-level mapping.

---

## Analysis Performed
- Mapped each sale to a region (West, South, Midwest, Northeast)
- Aggregated Total Sales by Region
- Aggregated Total Profit by Region
- Compared revenue contribution vs profitability across regions
- Visualized region-wise performance using bar charts

---

## Key Insights
- The West region is the top contributor in both Sales and Profit,
  indicating strong demand and scalability.
- The South region also performs well, showing healthy revenue and
  profitability.
- The Midwest demonstrates stable but moderate performance.
- The Northeast underperforms in both Sales and Profit, suggesting
  structural challenges rather than temporary fluctuations.

---

## Business Impact
- Regional performance is uneven, creating dependency on a few strong
  geographies.
- Underperforming regions can negatively affect overall growth if not
  addressed.
- High-performing regions present opportunities for expansion and
  premium offerings.

---

## Business Recommendations
- Scale marketing, inventory, and premium product initiatives in
  high-performing regions (West and South).
- Conduct pricing, logistics, and demand analysis for the Northeast to
  identify improvement opportunities.
- Allocate budgets and resources based on regional ROI rather than
  uniform distribution.
- Reduce geographic concentration risk by strengthening secondary
  regions.

---

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Lookup Functions (VLOOKUP)
- Data Visualization (Bar Charts)

---

## Key Learning
Region-level analysis enables localized, data-driven strategies and
helps businesses balance growth with risk management.
