# Day 15 – State-wise Top & Bottom Performers Analysis

## Objective
Identify the top-performing and underperforming states based on sales
to understand revenue concentration, uncover inefficiencies, and
support data-driven geographic decision-making.

---

## Dataset
Source: Regional Sales Dataset  
Primary Table: Sales Orders  

State-level sales data was analyzed after completing region-level
performance analysis.

---

## Analysis Performed
- Aggregated Total Sales at the state level
- Identified Top 10 States by Sales
- Identified Bottom 10 States by Sales
- Compared performance extremes to understand revenue distribution
- Visualized results using separate bar charts for clarity

---

## Key Insights
- Sales are highly concentrated in a small number of states, with a few
  states contributing a disproportionately large share of total revenue.
- California is the dominant revenue driver, significantly outperforming
  other states.
- Several states contribute minimal sales, creating a wide performance
  gap between top and bottom markets.
- National-level or regional-level analysis alone can hide these
  state-level disparities.

---

## Business Impact
- Heavy reliance on a small set of high-performing states increases
  geographic concentration risk.
- Uniform investment across all states can lead to inefficient use of
  resources.
- State-level visibility enables more precise and ROI-driven decisions.

---

## Business Recommendations
- Prioritize inventory, marketing, and sales expansion in top-performing
  states to maximize revenue impact.
- Conduct pricing, logistics, and demand analysis for bottom-performing
  states to identify improvement opportunities.
- Apply state-specific strategies instead of blanket national
  approaches.
- Consider reducing or restructuring investments in consistently
  underperforming states.

---

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Sorting & Filtering
- Data Visualization (Bar Charts)

---

## Key Learning
Granular, state-level analysis reveals growth opportunities and risks
that are often hidden at higher levels of aggregation.
