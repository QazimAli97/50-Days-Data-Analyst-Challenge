## Day 19 – Regional Product Dependency & Concentration Risk Analysis

### Objective
To analyze how individual products depend on specific regions by evaluating
**percentage contribution of regional sales**, instead of relying only on absolute revenue.

This helps identify:
- Regional concentration risk
- Product scalability across geographies
- Structural underperformance across regions

---

### Dataset
- Regional sales transactional data
- Products: 30
- Regions: West, South, Midwest, Northeast

---

### Analysis Performed
- Identified **Top and Bottom products by sales**
- Calculated **region-wise sales contribution (%)** per product
- Compared dependency patterns across regions
- Visualized results using percentage-based bar charts in Excel

---

### Key Insights
- Some top products are highly dependent on a single region, creating concentration risk
- A few products show balanced regional contribution, indicating stronger scalability
- Bottom products demonstrate weak and uneven regional presence
- Northeast region consistently contributes a lower share across multiple products
- Percentage-based analysis reveals risks hidden by absolute sales numbers

---

### Business Recommendations
- Reduce over-dependence on single regions for high-performing products
- Expand region-balanced products into underperforming markets
- Apply region-specific pricing and promotional strategies
- Reposition or rationalize products with weak performance across all regions

---

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Percentage Analysis, Charts)

---

### Key Learning
High sales do not guarantee stability.
Understanding **where sales come from** is critical for managing risk and planning sustainable growth.
