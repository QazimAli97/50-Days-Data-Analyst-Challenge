# Day 11 – Monthly & Seasonality Analysis

## Objective
Analyze **monthly seasonality patterns** in Sales and Profit by aggregating data across multiple years to identify recurring demand and profitability cycles.

The goal was to isolate **month-level behavior** independent of year-over-year growth.

## Work Performed

- Extracted **Month attributes** from Order Date
- Aggregated **Total Sales** and **Total Profit** by month across all years

- Created line charts to visualize seasonality patterns
- Interpreted results from a **business decision-making perspective**

---

## Key Insights

- Sales show clear **seasonal variation**, with strong performance at the beginning of the year
- Mid-year months experience relatively **lower demand**
- Sales stabilize and recover toward the later months
- Profit does not always move in line with sales, indicating **margin pressure** during certain periods
- Consistent patterns across years suggest **predictable seasonality**
