# 🚀 50 Days of Data Analyst Challenge – Sales Analytics

This repository documents my **50 Days Data Analyst Challenge**, a hands-on project designed to simulate a **real-world, end-to-end data analytics workflow** using **Excel, SQL, and Power BI**.

The project focuses on transforming **raw sales transaction data** into **meaningful, actionable business insights** through structured analysis, data modeling, and visualization.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Sales teams often lack a clear, data-driven understanding of performance across **regions, products, and customer segments**.  
Without structured analysis, it becomes difficult to identify:

- Profitability drivers  
- Seasonal trends  
- Operational inefficiencies  

As a result, strategic decisions related to **pricing, inventory planning, regional focus, and customer targeting** are frequently made with limited visibility.

This project aims to analyze **historical sales data** to uncover trends, evaluate performance, and support **informed, data-backed decision-making**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To demonstrate how a **data analyst approaches a business problem from start to finish** by:

- Understanding the business context behind the data  
- Cleaning and validating raw transactional data  
- Structuring data for scalable analysis  
- Deriving key business KPIs  
- Building clear and interactive dashboards  
- Communicating insights effectively  

---

## ❓ Key Business Questions

- How do sales and profitability vary across regions and sales channels?  
- Which products and customers contribute the most to total revenue?  
- Are there seasonal or time-based trends impacting sales performance?  
- How efficient is the order fulfillment and shipping process?  
- Which areas show potential for performance optimization?  

---

## 📊 Key Metrics & KPIs (Derived)

The following KPIs are derived from the available fact data:

- **Total Sales**  
- **Total Profit**  
- **Profit Margin**  
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**  
- **Order Count**  
- **Time-based Trends** (Monthly / Yearly)

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized to reflect a **professional analytics workflow**:

```text
data/
├── raw/            → Original dataset
├── cleaned/        → Cleaned and prepared data

50days challenge/   → 50 days work

sql/                → SQL scripts (added progressively)  
power_bi/           → Power BI reports and dashboards 


Each **Day folder** contains:

- A short README explaining the task and learning  
- Supporting screenshots or files from that day  
```

## 📈 Data Modeling Approach

The transactional sales data is progressively structured into a **fact-based analytical model** to ensure accurate aggregation and reporting.

- **Fact Table**: Sales orders (quantity, sales value, cost)  
- **Dimension Attributes**: Customer, Product, Region, Channel, Date  

This approach supports **reliable filtering, KPI calculations, and scalable analysis** in Power BI.
